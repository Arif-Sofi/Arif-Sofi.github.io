												<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For Assignment 1, I had to attend an industrial talk from the company Clarity Techwork Sdn. Bhd. on the 14th November 2023.
												The talk covered a lot of information and knowledge about what it is like to work under them and the working conditions of the company.
												They talked about the company values and what their goals/future views was, which was very eye opening for a first year student who had 
												no knowledge on this topic. Moreover, each speaker talked about their first experiences working for the company and even encouraged us
												to join them in the future.

												who are managing the Universities Internet Service and other technical relations. This talk was held on 5th of December 2023 via Webex. The 
												speakers talked about alot of networking related topics such as the understanding of campus connectivity, enhanced cybersecurity awareness, 
												efficient tech support services and optimized collaboration tools. I gained a lot of knowledge from attending the talk as it gave me insights 
												into understanding technical challenges, appreciation for cybersecurity measures and potential networking opportunities.</p>

												<h3>Assignment 3</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For Assignment 3, I had to attend an industrial talk given by a Professional AI Operator who was working under TM, on the 28th December 2023.
												The talk covered a lot of information and knowledge about what it is like to work on AI related job prospect. The speaker even shared her 
												experiences on what it was like to become a successful system develepor. She had asked us students on what they think would make a successful
												system develepor, and in my opinion, to become a successful system develepor in 4 years, I need to improve certain skills like technical and soft skills. 
												Certain technical skills like improving programming abilities as well as understanding other programmer’s codes and soft skills like communication
												and building a strong sense of leadership skills.

												<h3>Assignment 4</h3>

											<p>	Next up is Assignment 4, where I had to attend an industrial visit to the Indah Water Reasearch Centre on 3rd January 2024. This
												visit made me learn about the practical usage of certain technological systems, like managing a smooth network throughout a facility in order
												for a more efficient result. During the visit we visited many sites that are related to network, system servers and etc. It was a very interesting 
												visit and made me learn various practical usage of technology.

												<h3>Assignment 5</h3>

											<p>Furthermore, for Assignment number 5, I had to learn how to assemble and disassemble a PC with the tower. We had 
												to learn through various ways like watching a list of videos provided by our instructor and having to practically
												do it ourselves. This Assignment was very helpful in the long for students who are interested in building their
												very own PC or for someone who would like to working in the hardware sectore of Engineering. The PC Assembly part
												was very insightful for someone who has never assembled a PC.

												<h3>Assignment 6</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	Finally is Assignment 6, as an aspiring software engineer, my goal/ dream in regards to my course is becoming a successful one. 
												I particularly have an interest in the concept of game development, website making and entertainment related programming topics. 
												With design thinking being apart of this course's assignment, it helped me realize the struggles and dedication of working within 
												a team and is making me prepare for the future of working within an organization. With this experience gained, I can prepare as 
												early as now to get a head start in game development among other programmers. In order to succeed, my plan of action to improve 
												my potential is to be more involved in the practical side of programming in order to familiarize myself and get a feel of the 
												working environment in order to become well-adjusted with the career prospects.
